Build and Deploy Your Custom RAG-Based English Pop Music Advisor Chatbot

Introduction

Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot can significantly enhance the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This guide will walk you through creating a RAG-based English pop music advisor chatbot using Gradio and the Hugging Face APIs.

Why Use RAG for Music Recommendations?

RAG improves the performance of language models by augmenting them with external documents. This method retrieves relevant documents based on the user query and combines them with the original prompt before passing them to the language model for response generation. This approach ensures that the language model can access up-to-date and domain-specific information without the need for extensive retraining.

How RAG Enhances LLM’s Performance

	1.	Input: The question to which the LLM system responds is referred to as the input. Without RAG, the LLM responds directly to the question.
	2.	Indexing: With RAG, related documents are indexed by chunking them first, generating embeddings of the chunks, and indexing them into a vector store. At inference, the query is also embedded similarly.
	3.	Retrieval: Relevant documents are obtained by comparing the query against the indexed vectors, referred to as “Relevant Documents”.
	4.	Generation: The relevant documents are combined with the original prompt as additional context. The combined text and prompt are then passed to the model for response generation, resulting in the final output.

Prerequisites

Before you start creating your chatbot, make sure you have the following:

	•	A Hugging Face Account: Essential for accessing the platform where you’ll build and host your chatbot. Sign up here.

Setup and Deployment

	1.	Choosing Your Chatbot’s Identity: Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. This could be anything from recommending pop songs, providing music trivia, or even creating personalized playlists. The role you choose will define the interactions and capabilities of your chatbot.
	2.	Logging into Hugging Face: You’ll need an account to access the tools required for deploying your chatbot. If you don’t have an account, signing up is straightforward and quick.
	3.	Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces: Spaces are where the magic happens. This section of Hugging Face allows users to create and manage their applications seamlessly. Navigate to Spaces to get started.
	4.	Creating Your Space: Initiate a new space by clicking on ‘Create New Space’. It’s important that the name of your Space reflects the chatbot’s role, as it helps in identifying the application’s purpose at a glance.
	5.	Configuring Your Chatbot:
	•	Selecting the Framework and Model: Choose ‘Gradio’ as the framework for its user-friendly interface capabilities, and select a suitable model, such as ‘Zephyr 7B’, known for its versatility across various tasks.
	•	Customization: Here’s where you personalize the chatbot. Tailor system messages and interaction style based on the role. This customization will enable your chatbot to interact appropriately according to its role.
	•	Deployment: Once setup is complete, deploy your chatbot by simply clicking the create button. Deployment usually takes a couple of minutes. After this, your chatbot will be up and running and ready to interact.

Customization Example

To make your chatbot truly unique, consider personalizing it extensively. For instance, if you choose an ‘English Pop Music Advisor’ role:

	•	Modify the system messages to include engaging phrases and personalized music suggestions.
	•	Program the chatbot to ask about the user’s music preferences, favorite artists, and recent listens.
	•	Offer song recommendations, artist backgrounds, and similar song suggestions.
